In my testing suite, I tested various methods including the code lines given in the spec.

As I continued to test out new methods, I ran into problems while checking for unsigned versus signed immediates
and larger L values accepted by ld. I created separate files to specifically test these cases and ensure that the correct
immediate values were in bounds
